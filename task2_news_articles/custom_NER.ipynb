The man was acquitted of all charges by a special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act court in Mumbai. \\nThe man and the victim studied in the same school and had eloped in October 2014 to Tirupati. The girl's mother approached the police and lodged a missing complaint about her daughter. The police located the girl and the couple was brought back to Mumbai in January 2015. \\nAn investigation revealed that the man had been working at a restaurant in Tirupati for Rs 120. During the trial of the case, the man said (in sign language) that he should not be subjected to punishment for being 'in love'. He also told the court that he got married to the girl. \\nAccording to the Times of India's report, the court observed that the man wanted to start a family with the girl. The court also said that the girl agreed to elope with the man and she understood the depth of a relationship. The court further observed, \"She had willingly travelled with him in public transport. She never objected when he introduced her as his wife for procuring residence. \"\\n\\nRELATED NEWS \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKolkata man attacks daughter after she elopes with man of her choice \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPunjab: Teen tied to pole and burnt alive, girl's family punishes man's brother for elopement and marriage \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAndhra: Minor boy and girl who reportedly eloped week ago found dead\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring the trial, the court also stated that the documents presented on behalf of the girl were not ample proof of that fact that she was a minor at the time of the incident. The girl told the court that the deaf and mute man had forced her to establish physical relations with him. However, in her statement to the magistrate in 2015, the girl had accepted that her relationship was based on consent. \\nIn Tirupati, the couple lived in a crowded area. The court stated that the girl did not make a single attempt to get help, run away or escape from the house in Tirupati. The court said that the girl did not even make an attempt to flee from the area even when she used to go to the washroom alone. The court pointed out that the fact that the girl did not try to run away from Tirupati is evidence of the fact that the relationship was consensual.

The accused was arrested by the Rachakonda Police after he assaulted his wife under the influence of alcohol. He has been identified as V Muthyalu. \\nMuthyalu and his wife are residents of Ananthaiah Colony, Neredmet. On Saturday, the accused came to the house in an inebriated condition and thrashed his wife. Muthyalu works at a private company. \\nAn investigation revealed that Muthyalu's wife had lodged a complaint against him in 2017 as well. In 2017, the accused had harassed his wife. However, the matter was taken up in the Lok Adalat and was eventually resolved. Narsimha Swamy, inspector of Neredmet police station told the Times of India that the 40-year-old accused is addicted to alcohol. \\n\\nRELATED NEWS \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[VIDEO] Daughter-in-law accuses retired HC judge, wife and son of domestic violence; presents CCTV footage\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIrked over domestic violence, woman kills husband in Navi Mumbai\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMaharashtra: Woman kills two sons, hangs self over domestic violence in Thane\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the day of the incident, Muthyalu came to his house under the influence of alcohol and he assaulted his wife after the two had an argument. In an attempt to get help, Muthyalu's wife called her brother. Muthyalu allegedly attacked his brother-in-law with a knife. \\nInspector Narsimha Swamy said that the accused was suspecting his wife of infidelity. He said that the accused sustained a minor injury on his hand while attacking his brother-in-law. After he was arrested, Muthyalu approached the Rachakonda commissioner, claiming that he was manhandled by the police. A case was registered against the accused under section 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) and section 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Following this, the accused was sent to judicial remand. \\nThis is not the first instance where a woman has been subjected to domestic violence by her husband. In the past as well, there have been instances where women have been assaulted by their in-laws for dowry or other issues. Incidents like these expose the grim reality of society and the distorted thought process of people. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCITIES\\n\\n\\n                                            Delhi                                        \\n\\n                                            Mumbai                                        \\n\\n                                            Bengaluru                                        \\n\\n                                            Chennai                                        \\n\\n                                            Hyderabad                                        \\n\\n                                            Kolkata                                        \\n\\n                                            Ahmedabad                                        \\n\\n                                            Pune                                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTAP TO UNMUTE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIDEOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLockdown 5.0 | Still confused about interstate travel?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLockdown 5.0 brings relaxation but citizens facing issues due to lack of clarity? | The Urban Debate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLobby's dubious bid to incite India's Muslims? | The Newshour Debate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCM Arvind Kejriwal seals Delhi borders for a week, India unlocks but state blocks? | India Upfront\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n‘Best Video Content’ in an Auto Blog award | Swag Drive with Kranti feat Hyundai Venue - Delhi | Times Drive\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJUST IN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCyclone to reach Maha: Indian Navy ready to prove assistance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMonsoon status across India, here's what IMD has to say\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGovernor has appointed a BJP man, claims TMC\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nItaly records fewest new coronavirus cases since February\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNandan Nilekani on why people should work from office too!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOST READ\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGujarat: Man forces wife to accept his girlfriend, faces FIR\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWoman duped of Rs 9.5 lakh while upgrading SIM from 3G to 4G\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMinor girl raped multiple times by father during lockdown\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMan cons UAE traders, flees to Hyd on Vande Bharat flight\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHyderabad: Stressed over low salary, man commits suicide\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNEXT STORY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              Now Available On\\n           \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            \\n           \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              \\n           \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              \\n           \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              \\n           \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n           News\\n        \\n\\nHome\\n\\nBusiness\\nIndia Outbreak Report\\nLatest\\nCoronavirus News\\nIndia\\nTech\\nSports\\nHealth\\nSpirituality\\nEducation\\nLive TV\\nVideos\\nPhotos\\nBuzz\\nThe Newshour\\nIndia Upfront\\nTimes Channel Packs\\nToday\\nTrending News\\nAuto\\nDelhi\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n           Company\\n        \\n\\nAbout Us\\nContact Us\\nAdvertise with us\\nSyndication\\nEditorial Guidelines\\nRegulatory\\n\\n          Terms &amp; Conditions\\nPrivacy Policy\\nDisclaimer\\nComplaint Redressal\\nSitemap\\nFeedback\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n           Watch Live TV\\n        \\n\\nTimes NOW\\nET NOW\\nMirror NOW \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            © Bennett Coleman &amp; Company Limited\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

The man was acquitted of all charges by a special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act court in Mumbai. \\nThe man and the victim studied in the same school and had eloped in October 2014 to Tirupati. The girl's mother approached the police and lodged a missing complaint about her daughter. The police located the girl and the couple was brought back to Mumbai in January 2015. \\nAn investigation revealed that the man had been working at a restaurant in Tirupati for Rs 120. During the trial of the case, the man said (in sign language) that he should not be subjected to punishment for being 'in love'. He also told the court that he got married to the girl. \\nAccording to the Times of India's report, the court observed that the man wanted to start a family with the girl. The court also said that the girl agreed to elope with the man and she understood the depth of a relationship. The court further observed, \"She had willingly travelled with him in public transport. She never objected when he introduced her as his wife for procuring residence. \"\\n\\nRELATED NEWS \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKolkata man attacks daughter after she elopes with man of her choice \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPunjab: Teen tied to pole and burnt alive, girl's family punishes man's brother for elopement and marriage \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAndhra: Minor boy and girl who reportedly eloped week ago found dead\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring the trial, the court also stated that the documents presented on behalf of the girl were not ample proof of that fact that she was a minor at the time of the incident. The girl told the court that the deaf and mute man had forced her to establish physical relations with him. However, in her statement to the magistrate in 2015, the girl had accepted that her relationship was based on consent. \\nIn Tirupati, the couple lived in a crowded area. The court stated that the girl did not make a single attempt to get help, run away or escape from the house in Tirupati. The court said that the girl did not even make an attempt to flee from the area even when she used to go to the washroom alone. The court pointed out that the fact that the girl did not try to run away from Tirupati is evidence of the fact that the relationship was consensual. The court said that this a case where a \"differently-abled boy and girl who were in love chose to live together without parents' consent. \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCITIES\\n\\n\\n                                            Delhi                                        \\n\\n                                            Mumbai                                        \\n\\n                                            Bengaluru                                        \\n\\n                                            Chennai                                        \\n\\n                                            Hyderabad                                        \\n\\n                                            Kolkata                                        \\n\\n                                            Ahmedabad                                        \\n\\n                                            Pune                                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTAP TO UNMUTE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIDEOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLockdown 5.0 brings relaxation but citizens facing issues due to lack of clarity? | The Urban Debate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLobby's dubious bid to incite India's Muslims? | The Newshour Debate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCM Arvind Kejriwal seals Delhi borders for a week, India unlocks but state blocks? | India Upfront\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n‘Best Video Content’ in an Auto Blog award | Swag Drive with Kranti feat Hyundai Venue - Delhi | Times Drive\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmerica burns with hate but Lutyens sees parallels? | India Upfront\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJUST IN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCyclone to reach Maha: Indian Navy ready to prove assistance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMonsoon status across India, here's what IMD has to say\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGovernor has appointed a BJP man, claims TMC\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nItaly records fewest new coronavirus cases since February\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNandan Nilekani on why people should work from office too!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOST READ\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGujarat: Man forces wife to accept his girlfriend, faces FIR\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWoman duped of Rs 9.5 lakh while upgrading SIM from 3G to 4G\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMinor girl raped multiple times by father during lockdown\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMan cons UAE traders, flees to Hyd on Vande Bharat flight\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHyderabad: Stressed over low salary, man commits suicide\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNEXT STORY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              Now Available On\\n           \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            \\n           \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              \\n           \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              \\n           \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              \\n           \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n           News\\n        \\n\\nHome\\n\\nBusiness\\nIndia Outbreak Report\\nLatest\\nCoronavirus News\\nIndia\\nTech\\nSports\\nHealth\\nSpirituality\\nEducation\\nLive TV\\nVideos\\nPhotos\\nBuzz\\nThe Newshour\\nIndia Upfront\\nTimes Channel Packs\\nToday\\nTrending News\\nAuto\\nDelhi\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n           Company\\n        \\n\\nAbout Us\\nContact Us\\nAdvertise with us\\nSyndication\\nEditorial Guidelines\\nRegulatory\\n\\n          Terms & Conditions\\nPrivacy Policy\\nDisclaimer\\nComplaint Redressal\\nSitemap\\nFeedback\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n           Watch Live TV\\n        \\n\\nTimes NOW\\nET NOW\\nMirror NOW \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            © Bennett Coleman & Company Limited\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",

The accused was arrested by the Rachakonda Police after he assaulted his wife under the influence of alcohol. He has been identified as V Muthyalu. \\nMuthyalu and his wife are residents of Ananthaiah Colony, Neredmet. On Saturday, the accused came to the house in an inebriated condition and thrashed his wife. Muthyalu works at a private company. \\nAn investigation revealed that Muthyalu's wife had lodged a complaint against him in 2017 as well. In 2017, the accused had harassed his wife. However, the matter was taken up in the Lok Adalat and was eventually resolved. Narsimha Swamy, inspector of Neredmet police station told the Times of India that the 40-year-old accused is addicted to alcohol. \\n\\nRELATED NEWS \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[VIDEO] Daughter-in-law accuses retired HC judge, wife and son of domestic violence; presents CCTV footage\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIrked over domestic violence, woman kills husband in Navi Mumbai\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMaharashtra: Woman kills two sons, hangs self over domestic violence in Thane\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the day of the incident, Muthyalu came to his house under the influence of alcohol and he assaulted his wife after the two had an argument. In an attempt to get help, Muthyalu's wife called her brother. Muthyalu allegedly attacked his brother-in-law with a knife. \\nInspector Narsimha Swamy said that the accused was suspecting his wife of infidelity. He said that the accused sustained a minor injury on his hand while attacking his brother-in-law. After he was arrested, Muthyalu approached the Rachakonda commissioner, claiming that he was manhandled by the police. A case was registered against the accused under section 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) and section 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Following this, the accused was sent to judicial remand. \\nThis is not the first instance where a woman has been subjected to domestic violence by her husband. In the past as well, there have been instances where women have been assaulted by their in-laws for dowry or other issues. Incidents like these expose the grim reality of society and the distorted thought process of people. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCITIES\\n\\n\\n                                            Delhi                                        \\n\\n                                            Mumbai                                        \\n\\n                                            Bengaluru                                        \\n\\n                                            Chennai                                        \\n\\n                                            Hyderabad                                        \\n\\n                                            Kolkata                                        \\n\\n                                            Ahmedabad                                        \\n\\n                                            Pune                                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTAP TO UNMUTE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIDEOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLockdown 5.0 | Still confused about interstate travel?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLockdown 5.0 brings relaxation but citizens facing issues due to lack of clarity? | The Urban Debate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLobby's dubious bid to incite India's Muslims? | The Newshour Debate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCM Arvind Kejriwal seals Delhi borders for a week, India unlocks but state blocks? | India Upfront\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n‘Best Video Content’ in an Auto Blog award | Swag Drive with Kranti feat Hyundai Venue - Delhi | Times Drive\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJUST IN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCyclone to reach Maha: Indian Navy ready to prove assistance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMonsoon status across India, here's what IMD has to say\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGovernor has appointed a BJP man, claims TMC\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nItaly records fewest new coronavirus cases since February\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNandan Nilekani on why people should work from office too!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOST READ\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGujarat: Man forces wife to accept his girlfriend, faces FIR\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWoman duped of Rs 9.5 lakh while upgrading SIM from 3G to 4G\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMinor girl raped multiple times by father during lockdown\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMan cons UAE traders, flees to Hyd on Vande Bharat flight\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHyderabad: Stressed over low salary, man commits suicide\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNEXT STORY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              Now Available On\\n           \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            \\n           \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              \\n           \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              \\n           \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              \\n           \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n           News\\n        \\n\\nHome\\n\\nBusiness\\nIndia Outbreak Report\\nLatest\\nCoronavirus News\\nIndia\\nTech\\nSports\\nHealth\\nSpirituality\\nEducation\\nLive TV\\nVideos\\nPhotos\\nBuzz\\nThe Newshour\\nIndia Upfront\\nTimes Channel Packs\\nToday\\nTrending News\\nAuto\\nDelhi\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n           Company\\n        \\n\\nAbout Us\\nContact Us\\nAdvertise with us\\nSyndication\\nEditorial Guidelines\\nRegulatory\\n\\n          Terms & Conditions\\nPrivacy Policy\\nDisclaimer\\nComplaint Redressal\\nSitemap\\nFeedback\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n           Watch Live TV\\n        \\n\\nTimes NOW\\nET NOW\\nMirror NOW \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            © Bennett Coleman & Company Limited\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
